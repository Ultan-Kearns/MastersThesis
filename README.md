# Masters Thesis
## Proposal: Investigating the uses of Generative Adversarial Networks and optimal architecture for use in data generation for training models to diagnose COVID 19
### completed as part of Masters of Science in Computing in Big Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence in Atlantic Technological University Letterkenny, under the supervision of Dr. Paul Greaney

#### What is this project
This project was part of attaining a 60 credit MSc in Artificial Intelligence and Big Data Analytics.  This project aims to investigate the possibility of using artificially generated data generated by a Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) to train a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN).  Due to data shortage there have been many issues regarding the ability of current CNN models to generalize when diagnosing COVID-19 from X-rays when using a CNN, to combat this I have decided to investigate GANs to generate synthetic data to increase a model's abilitiy to generalize.  I also investigate transfer learning for automated COVID-19 diagnosis in this project and the results attained when using transfer learning with an augmented dataset.

## NOTES
+ The papers within the literature review folder were not written by me but by their respective authors
+ Many of the images within the thesis images folder were not created by me but belong to their respective creators(cited in thesis)
+ Datasets were not compiled by me original sources cited in thesis - also above in the sources for datasets section of this ReadMe
+ Extensive X-Ray dataset was too large to upload to this repo please use the link mentioned in sources for datasets
+ Due to limitations with Git LFS I was unable to save the GAN models to this repository will include link to drive at a later time.
