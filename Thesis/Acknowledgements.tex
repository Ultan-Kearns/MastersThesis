I would also like to thank the lecturers who taught me so much during my postgraduate course, both Doctors Karla Mu√±oz-Esqueival and Shagufta Henna provided a fantastic introduction into many areas of Artificial Intelligence and the knowledge they imparted has helped me a lot throughout the course of conducting this research.
